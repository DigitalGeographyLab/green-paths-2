Readme for the Tests

0. Test print out some random Java stuff in the end, ignore those, scroll up abit to see the short test results
1. The tests are really simple and swiftly written
2. Test should be made more comprehensive and excessive!
3. Routing and Analysing individual tests depend and require for preprocessing test to be run before them
    for they access the results/values from test db of the preprocessing module
4. The main goal for the module/pipeline tests is to run the process (should maybe mock) and see the test db that correct results are generated
5. Also output files are simply "checked"
6. Tests will empty db and test outputfiles before and after (outputs) of the tests
